- Who is responsible for what needs to be made  explicit. 
- In essence the Data Provider (or the projects Principle Investigator) is ultimately responsible for their data.
- The Data Receiver should not make any changes without explicit permission from the owner of the data.
- This should be said upfront at the beginning of collaboration, and then we
can go on to talk about the sort of checks and modifications the receiver might run, etc.
