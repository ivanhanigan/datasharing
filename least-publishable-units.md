title: Least Publishable Units (LPU)
---

- The concept of Least Publishable Units (LPU) allows us to compartmentalise portions of data collections into a subcollection called the LPU (also 'the dataset'). 
- Each LPU may contain more than one data file that are logically, scientifically or thematically
related. 
- A LPU may need to be constructed from merging or modification of the existing files
