For maximum speed in the analysis this is the information you should pass to a statistician:

1. The raw data.
2. A [tidy data set](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf) 
3. A code book describing each variable and its values in the tidy data set.  
4. An explicit and exact recipe you used to go from 1 -> 2,3
