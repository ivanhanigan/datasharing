You may have heard this before, but [reproducibility is kind of a big deal in computational science](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/334/6060/1226).
That means, when you submit your paper, the reviewers and the rest of the world should be able to exactly replicate
the analyses from raw data all the way to final results. If you are trying to be efficient, you will likely perform
some summarization/data analysis steps before the data can be considered tidy. 

The ideal thing for you to do when performing summarization is to create a computer script (in `R`, `Python`, or something else) 
that takes the raw data as input and produces the tidy data you are sharing as output. You can try running your script
a couple of times and see if the code produces the same output. 

In many cases, the person who collected the data has incentive to make it tidy for a statistician to speed the process
of collaboration. They may not know how to code in a scripting language. In that case, what you should provide the statistician
is something called [pseudocode](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode). It should look something like:

1. Step 1 - take the raw file, run version 3.1.2 of summarize software with parameters a=1, b=2, c=3
1. Step 2 - run the software separately for each sample
1. Step 3 - take column three of outputfile.out for each sample and that is the corresponding row in the output data set

You should also include information about which system (Mac/Windows/Linux) you used the software on and whether you 
tried it more than once to confirm it gave the same results. Ideally, you will run this by a fellow student/labmate
to confirm that they can obtain the same output file you did.
