#### How to share data to avoid misunderstanding 

This is a guide for anyone who needs to share data with another analyst and wants to avoid the other person misunderstanding the data. This is based on the original by Jeff Leek at [https://github.com/jtleek/datasharing](https://github.com/jtleek/datasharing).

The working document is in the gh-pages branch, in which I will modify the original words to suit my own purposes (and hopefully are generalisable for others too).  For now most of it is still the original.
